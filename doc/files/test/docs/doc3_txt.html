When you have heart failure , it is very important to exercise regularly.
If you are not already active, your doctor may want you to begin an
exercise program. Of course, a safe level of exercise will depend on your
specific diagnosis and stage of heart failure. But even if you can only do
a small amount of exercise, it is better than not doing any exercise at
all.
</p>
<p>
Key points
</p>
<p>
Have a checkup before beginning an exercise program. Your doctor probably
will do an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) and possibly an exercise stress
test to see how much activity your heart can safely handle. Your doctor may
recommend a supervised cardiac rehabilitation program at a local hospital
or clinic. For more information, see the topic Cardiac Rehabilitation .
Start out slowly, exercising for only a few minutes at a comfortable rate.
Then each day, try gradually to increase the length of time and the
intensity of your workout. You should not exercise during times when your
heart failure is not under control. Set goals that you can reach. If you
expect too much, you are likely to become discouraged and to stop
exercising. What do I need to know about exercise and heart failure? Why do
I need a regular exercise program? How can I get started on an exercise

What do I need to know about exercise and heart failure?
</p>
<p>
Do not start exercising until you have talked with your doctor. The
American Heart Association recommends that your exercise program include
activities that you can do at least 3 to 5 times a week.1 You may need a
day of rest between sessions. Exercise programs usually include:
</p>
<p>
Stretching for 10 to 15 minutes, which helps warm up muscles before
exercising. Beginning yoga or tai chi exercises might help increase your
flexibility. Walking, cycling on a stationary bike, using a treadmill,
doing low- or no-impact aerobics, and swimming, which all are exercises
that strengthen your muscles, help you keep your balance, and improve your
conditioning. Exercising for 20 to 30 minutes is recommended by the
American Heart Association. Strength-building exercises using light
weights, which helps increase the tone and strength of your muscles. A
cool-down period. This means gradually stopping your exercise, such as
walking at a slower pace for 5 to 10 minutes. Test Your Knowledge

Why do I need a regular exercise program?
</p>
<p>
Exercising 3 or 4 times a week consistently is important because it takes
only a short period without activity to weaken your muscles and your
cardiovascular system.

Regular exercise also helps reduce:
</p>
<p>
Chest pain ( angina ) and symptoms of heart failure. Cholesterol ,
especially when combined with lifestyle changes, such as eating a balanced
diet, not smoking, and reducing stress. Blood pressure. When combined with
other lifestyle changes, such as eating a balanced diet and learning to
handle stress, regular exercise can decrease your risk for coronary artery
disease . Your weight, or it can help control your weight, which can

<p>
How can I get started on an exercise program?
</p>
<p>
You can get started by doing the following:
</p>
<p>
Have a thorough physical exam before starting any exercise program. Your
doctor may do an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) and possibly an exercise
stress test to see what level of activity your heart can handle. Make a
list of questions to discuss with your doctor. Do this before your
appointment. For some general questions, see the exercise planning sheet
(What is a PDF document?). Make an exercise plan together with your doctor.
An exercise program usually consists of stretching, activities that
increase your heart rate (aerobic exercise), and strength training (lifting
light weights). Visit a library or bookstore for information on exercise
programs. Join a health club, walking group, or YMCA. Many cities have
senior centers that offer inexpensive exercise programs. See the Other
Places to Get Help section of the topic Heart Failure for additional
resources. Learn how to check your heart rate. See taking a pulse . Your
doctor can tell you how fast your pulse (target heart rate) should be when
you exercise. Start out slowly. Try parking farther away from the store or
walk the mall before shopping. Over time, you will increase your ability to
do more. Keep a record of your daily exercise. It is okay to skip a day
occasionally or to cut back on your exercise if you are too tired or not
feeling well. Tips for exercise success
</p>
<p>
Set realistic goals. If you expect too much, you are likely to become
discouraged and to stop exercising. Choose a type of exercise that you
enjoy. Give yourself time. It can take months to get into the habit of
exercising. After a few months, you may find that you are looking forward
to it. Stay with it. It can be hard to stick with an exercise plan. Try
exercising with a friendait is much easier to continue an exercise program
if you are exercising with someone else. Reward yourself. Build in rewards
along the way that help you continue your program. When starting an
exercise program, keep the following precautions in mind:
</p>
<p>
Pace yourself by alternating exercises. Rotate light workouts, such as
short walks, with more strenuous exercises, such as low-impact aerobics or
swimming. Avoid exercising outdoors in extreme temperatures or high
humidity. When the weather is bad, try exercising indoors at a gym or
walking at a mall. Avoid exercises that require or encourage holding your
breath, such as push-ups, sit-ups, and isometric exercises. Also avoid
heavy lifting. If you develop palpitations, chest pain, difficulty
breathing, or dizziness or lightheadedness, stop exercising and rest. Call
your doctor if these symptoms don&#8216;t go away. Do not take hot or cold
showers or sauna baths after exercising. Moderate temperatures are
bestavery hot or very cold temperatures can be dangerous. Ask your doctor
about continuing your exercise program if your medicines change. New
medicines can affect how fast your heart beats and how you feel when you
exercise. Don&#8216;t take naps or lie down after exercise because that
reduces exercise tolerance. Instead, sit down to rest. Take your pulse
frequently or wear a heart rate monitor and keep your pulse within the
range your doctor sets. Watch your pulse when walking up hills or stairs.
Be aware of how you feel while exercising. You should be able to talk
easily without being out of breath. Make sure you adjust your exercise
program if it is interrupted for more than just a couple of days. Gradually
increase to your regular activity level as tolerated. Test Your Knowledge
