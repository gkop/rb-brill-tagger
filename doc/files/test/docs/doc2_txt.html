Topic Overview
</p>
<p>
What is actinic keratosis, and what causes it?
</p>
<p>
Actinic keratosis, also called solar or senile keratosis, is a precancerous
skin condition that develops in sun-exposed skin, especially on the face,
hands, forearms, and the neck. It is seen most often in pale-skinned,
fair-haired, light-eyed people, beginning at age 30 or 40 and becoming more
common with age.
</p>
<p>
What are the symptoms?
</p>
<p>
Actinic keratoses are small and noticeable red, brown, or skin-colored
patches that don&#8216;t go away. They commonly occur on the head, neck, or
hands but can be found on other areas of the body. Usually more than one is
present. They may:
</p>
<p>
Have a rough texture. Itch, burn, or sting. Range in size from 1 to 3 mm or
larger (about the size of a small pea). Be numerous, with several patches
close together. Be surrounded by red, irritated skin. Actinic keratosis
needs to be evaluated by a health professional, especially if the keratoses
become painful, bleed, become open sores, become infected, or increase in
size.
</p>
<p>
How is actinic keratosis diagnosed?
</p>
<p>
Actinic keratosis is diagnosed through a skin examination. Your health
professional may use a bright light or magnifying lens to look for growths,
moles, or lesions. The scalp is examined by parting the hair. If there is a
possibility of cancer, your health professional may take a sample of your
skin and test ( biopsy ) it.
</p>
<p>
How is it treated?
</p>
<p>
Early treatment of actinic keratosis is recommended to stop the possible
progression to a type of skin cancer ( squamous cell carcinoma ). Treatment
may include:
</p>
<p>
Freezing the skin growth with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy) to destroy it.
Cryotherapy can cause mild pain that can last up to 3 days. Healing
generally takes 7 to 14 days, and there is little or no scarring, though
some people with darker skin have permanent skin color lightening. This
procedure can be done in your health professional&#8216;s office. Scraping
and using electric current (curettage and electrosurgery). The skin is
numbed, and the growth is scraped off using a spoon-shaped instrument
(curet). After scraping, electrosurgery may be done to control bleeding and
destroy any remaining abnormal cells. Curettage is a quick treatment, but
it can cause scarring. Occasionally a thick scar, or keloid, develops after
curettage treatment. A keloid can be itchy or grow larger over time but it
doesn&#8216;t require medical treatment. Fluorouracil (5-FU), a medication
that you put directly on the keratoses. Imiquimod cream (Aldara), a
medication that has recently been approved for treating actinic keratosis.
The cream changes the body&#8216;s response to sun exposure, helping to
prevent the formation of keratoses. Will actinic keratosis progress to
cancer?
</p>
<p>
If you have actinic keratosis, you may have an increased risk of developing
squamous cell carcinoma. There is no way to determine whether actinic
keratosis will progress to squamous cell carcinoma or how fast this might
occur. Keratoses on the ear and lip are at the highest risk of developing
into cancer because of the sensitivity of the ear and lip to sun exposure.
</p>
<p>
How can I prevent actinic keratosis?
</p>
<p>
You can help prevent actinic keratosis by staying out of the sun and using
sunscreen when you are in the sun. You should also examine your skin for
the condition and other suspicious growths once a month, especially if you
spend a lot of time in the sun.
</p>
<p>
Skin protection
</p>
<p>
To protect your skin:
</p>
<p>
Limit your exposure to the sun, especially from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00
p.m.ahours of peak ultraviolet (UV) exposure. Wear protective clothing,
including a wide-brimmed hat, a long-sleeved shirt, and pants. Wear
sunglasses that block out UV rays. Use a sunscreen that blocks ultraviolet
rays (both UVA and UVB) and has a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least
15 every day, all year, even when it is cloudy. Avoid tanning booths and
sunlamps, which emit UV radiation and can cause skin damage and increase
the risk of skin cancer. Related Information
