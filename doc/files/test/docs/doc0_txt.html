Take an active role in your care When it comes to making decisions about
the goals and direction of treatment, don&#8216;t sit back. Work closely
and actively with your oncologist and the rest of your medical team. Dont
overlook clinical trials If youre eligible to enroll in clinical trials,
select an oncologist who participates in them. Patients who enroll in
clinical studies receive closer follow-up, the highest standard-of-care
treatment and access to experimental therapies at no extra cost. Maximize
your nutrition strategy Doing your best to eat a healthy, well-balanced
diet is vital to prompt healing after surgery and for recovery from
radiation or chemotherapy. Many oncology practices employ registered
dieticians who can help you optimize your nutrition. Steer clear of
&quot;natural cures&quot; Before trying nutritional supplements or herbal
remedies, be sure to discuss your plans with a doctor. Most have not been
tested in clinical studies, and some may actually interfere with your
treatment. Build a stronger body Even walking regularly is can help you
minimize long-term muscle weakness caused by illness or de-conditioning.
Focus on overall health Patients may be cured of cancer but still face
life-threatening medical problems that are underemphasized during cancer
treatments, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.
Continue to monitor your overall health. Put the fire out for good Smoking
impairs healing after surgery and radiation and increases your risk of
cardiovascular disease and many types of cancers. Ask your doctor for help
identifying and obtaining the most appropriate cessation aids. Map a
healthy future Once youve completed treatment, discuss appropriate
follow-up plans with your doctor and keep track of them yourself.
Intensified screening over many years is frequently recommended to identify
and treat a recurrence early on. Share your feelings Allow yourself time to
discuss the emotional consequences of your illness and treatment with
family, friends, your doctor and, if necessary, a professional therapist.
Many patients also find antidepressants helpful during treatment. Stay
connected Although many newly diagnosed patients fear they will not be able
to keep working during treatment, this is usually not the case. Working,
even at a reduced schedule, helps you maintain valuable social connections
and weekly structure.
