Brand Name Chemical Name Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR bupropion Cymbalta
duloxetine Remeron mirtazapine Desyrel trazodone Effexor, Effexor XR
venlafaxine These medications are antidepressant medications that do not
fit well into any of the other medication categories. They are taken in
tablet form (orally).
</p>
<p>
How It Works
</p>
<p>
Bupropion, duloxetine, mirtazapine, trazodone, and venlafaxine balance
certain brain chemicals ( neurotransmitters ). When these brain chemicals
are balanced, the symptoms of depression are relieved.
</p>
<p>
Why It Is Used
</p>
<p>
These medications may be tried when other antidepressants are not effective
or have problematic side effects. They may be used on their own or along
with another drug.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other
antidepressants can cause significant problems with sexual function.
Bupropion is less likely to cause sexual dysfunction than other
antidepressants, such as SSRIs. When sexual dysfunction side effects occur,
bupropion may be prescribed instead of, or in addition to, an SSRI.
</p>
<p>
Mirtazapine may be useful if you are experiencing insomnia or agitation.
</p>
<p>
Trazodone is often used along with an SSRI to help with sleep disturbances.
</p>
<p>
When these drugs are not used
</p>
<p>
You should not take one of these medicines if you have had an allergic
reaction to it in the past or if you have taken a monoamine oxidase
inhibitor (MAOI) within the past 2 weeks. If you have taken an MAOI within
the past 2 weeks, taking bupropion may cause life-threatening high blood
pressure.
</p>
<p>
You should not take duloxetine if you have uncontrolled narrow-angle
glaucoma, liver disease, or abnormal liver function tests.
</p>
<p>
You should not take bupropion if you have had a seizure or an eating
disorder.
</p>
<p>
You should not take trazodone if you are recovering from a recent heart
attack or have carcinoid syndrome.
</p>
<p>
Although sometimes used in children, these medications have not been
approved for use in people under the age of 18.
</p>
<p>
How Well It Works
</p>
<p>
These antidepressants may be as effective as selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating depression. Bupropion, duloxetine,
mirtazapine, trazodone, and venlafaxine are all effective in treating
adults. Venlafaxine is not effective in treating children or adolescents
who have depression. Experts are still studying whether bupropion is an
effective medicine for children or adolescents.
</p>
<p>
Side Effects
</p>
<p>
Bupropion, duloxetine, mirtazapine, trazodone, and venlafaxine have
different side effects than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), cyclic antidepressants, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
</p>
<p>
Trazodone has numerous side effects, and in rare cases, some can be severe.
</p>
<p>
The most common side effects of each of these medications are listed below.
</p>
<p>
Duloxetine possible side effects
</p>
<p>
Nausea Dry mouth Constipation Decreased appetite Fatigue Sleepiness
Increased sweating Sexual dysfunction Other more serious side effects are
rare but can include liver problems (particularly in patients who drink a
lot of alcohol), increased blood pressure, activation of mania or
hypomania, seizures, and mydriasis (pupil dilation), which can cause
problems for people with narrow-angle glaucoma.
</p>
<p>
Side effects when discontinuing duloxetine can include dizziness, nausea,
headache, paresthesia (abnormal touch sensation or tingling), vomiting,
irritability, and nightmares.
</p>
<p>
Bupropion possible side effects
</p>
<p>
Weight loss of more than 5 lb Agitation, confusion, nervousness, and
anxiety In rare cases, bupropion can cause other adverse effects, some of
them serious, such as allergic reactions, dry mouth, headaches, heart
palpitations, and seizures.
</p>
<p>
Mirtazapine possible side effects
</p>
<p>
Drowsiness Increased appetite or weight gain Increased cholesterol levels
Dizziness Dry mouth Constipation Other more serious side effects are rare
but can include agranulocytosis (insufficient white blood cell count),
allergic reactions, and liver or pancreas problems.
</p>
<p>
Venlafaxine possible side effects
</p>
<p>
Constipation Headaches Weight loss Dry mouth Slight increase in cholesterol
Hypertension Sexual dysfunction Side effects when discontinuing venlafaxine
can include dizziness, nausea, headache, abnormal touch sensation or
tingling ( paresthesia ), vomiting, irritability, and nightmares.
</p>
<p>
Trazodone possible side effects
</p>
<p>
Drowsiness Dizziness or lightheadedness Blurred vision Weight gain Dry
mouth Constipation Headache Nausea Side effects may also include priapism ,
a painful condition in which the penis stays erect. If this happens, call
your doctor at once.
</p>
<p>
FDA Advisories. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued
advisories to patients, families, and health care providers recommending
that children and adults taking antidepressants should be watched for
warning signs of suicide . The FDA has also asked drug companies to include
extensive packaging information warning about the danger of suicidal
thoughts or actions during antidepressant use. This is especially important
at the beginning of treatment or when doses are changed.
</p>
<p>
The FDA does not recommend that people stop using antidepressants. The FDA
does advise that anyone taking antidepressants should be watched for
increased anxiety, panic attacks, agitation, irritability, insomnia,
impulsivity, hostility, and mania. It is most important to watch for these
behaviors in children, who may be less able to control their impulsivity
and therefore may be at greater risk for suicidal behavior.
</p>
<p>
Do not stop antidepressant use suddenly. Talk to your health professional
about any concerns you may have.
</p>
<p>
See Drug Reference for a full list of side effects. (Drug Reference is not
available in all systems.)
</p>
<p>
What To Think About
</p>
<p>
Bupropion may trigger seizures in some people. You will probably want to
avoid taking this medication if you have a history of seizures or eating
disorders.
</p>
<p>
You may start to feel better within 1 to 3 weeks of taking antidepressant
medicine. But it can take as many as 6 to 8 weeks to see more improvement.
If you have questions or concerns about your medicines, or if you do not
notice any improvement by 3 weeks, talk to your doctor.
</p>
<p>
These medications should not be used along with monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (MAOIs) because serious, sometimes fatal, reactions can occur.
To avoid serious reactions, wait at least 14 days after ending an MAOI
treatment before beginning treatment with any one of these medications.
