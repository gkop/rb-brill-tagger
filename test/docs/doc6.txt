These medications are antidepressant medications that do not fit well into any of the other medication categories. They are taken in tablet form (orally).

How It Works

Bupropion, duloxetine, mirtazapine, trazodone, and venlafaxine balance certain brain chemicals ( neurotransmitters ). When these brain chemicals are balanced, the symptoms of depression are relieved.

Why It Is Used

These medications may be tried when other antidepressants are not effective or have problematic side effects. They may be used on their own or along with another drug.

Sometimes certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other antidepressants can cause significant problems with sexual function. Bupropion is less likely to cause sexual dysfunction than other antidepressants, such as SSRIs. When sexual dysfunction side effects occur, bupropion may be prescribed instead of, or in addition to, an SSRI.

Mirtazapine may be useful if you are experiencing insomnia or agitation.

Trazodone is often used along with an SSRI to help with sleep disturbances.

When these drugs are not used

You should not take one of these medicines if you have had an allergic reaction to it in the past or if you have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within the past 2 weeks. If you have taken an MAOI within the past 2 weeks, taking bupropion may cause life-threatening high blood pressure.

You should not take duloxetine if you have uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, liver disease, or abnormal liver function tests.

You should not take bupropion if you have had a seizure or an eating disorder.

You should not take trazodone if you are recovering from a recent heart attack or have carcinoid syndrome.

Although sometimes used in children, these medications have not been approved for use in people under the age of 18.

How Well It Works

These antidepressants may be as effective as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating depression. Bupropion, duloxetine, mirtazapine, trazodone, and venlafaxine are all effective in treating adults. Venlafaxine is not effective in treating children or adolescents who have depression. Experts are still studying whether bupropion is an effective medicine for children or adolescents.

FDA Advisories. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued advisories to patients, families, and health care providers recommending that children and adults taking antidepressants should be watched for warning signs of suicide . The FDA has also asked drug companies to include extensive packaging information warning about the danger of suicidal thoughts or actions during antidepressant use. This is especially important at the beginning of treatment or when doses are changed.

The FDA does not recommend that people stop using antidepressants. The FDA does advise that anyone taking antidepressants should be watched for increased anxiety, panic attacks, agitation, irritability, insomnia, impulsivity, hostility, and mania. It is most important to watch for these behaviors in children, who may be less able to control their impulsivity and therefore may be at greater risk for suicidal behavior.

Do not stop antidepressant use suddenly. Talk to your health professional about any concerns you may have.

See Drug Reference for a full list of side effects. (Drug Reference is not available in all systems.)

What To Think About

Bupropion may trigger seizures in some people. You will probably want to avoid taking this medication if you have a history of seizures or eating disorders.

You may start to feel better within 1 to 3 weeks of taking antidepressant medicine. But it can take as many as 6 to 8 weeks to see more improvement. If you have questions or concerns about your medicines, or if you do not notice any improvement by 3 weeks, talk to your doctor.

These medications should not be used along with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) because serious, sometimes fatal, reactions can occur. To avoid serious reactions, wait at least 14 days after ending an MAOI treatment before beginning treatment with any one of these medications.
