I seem to be salivating more than usual. I feel like I constantly have to swallow and wipe the corners of my mouth. I am 60 years old and otherwise in good health. What causes excessive saliva?

No name, No state given

Excessive saliva is usually a temporary problem and rarely a cause for concern.

Normally, your salivary glands produce 1 to 2 quarts (0.95 to 1.89 liters) of saliva a day. However, because swallowing occurs continually and unconsciously, you don't generally notice the saliva. If you suddenly seem to have excessive saliva in your mouth, it may be because your salivary glands are making more saliva than usual (sialorrhea) or because you are swallowing less often.

Causes of increased saliva production include:

Pregnancy
New dentures
Inflammation of mucous membranes of the mouth (stomatitis)
A side effect of certain medications, such as clozapine, isoproterenol, pilocarpine and reserpine
Damage to the nerves that control the salivary glands
Causes of a decreased ability to swallow or to retain saliva in your mouth include:

Neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or cerebral palsy
Nasal obstruction, such as due to allergies, sinus infection, nasal polyps and enlarged adenoids
Gastroesophageal reflux
Sjogren's syndrome
Bell's palsy
If you're concerned about excessive salivation, consult your doctor or dentist. It's important to determine if the problem is due to increased saliva production or a decreased ability to swallow.

Treatment of persistent, excessive salivation is directed at the underlying cause, if possible. Anticholinergic medications, such as transdermal scopolamine, can be used to decrease saliva. Although anticholinergics may help in severe cases of drooling, these medications aren't always effective and can cause side effects.
