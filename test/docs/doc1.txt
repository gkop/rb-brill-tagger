Breast Cancer Q&A: Cancer Pain

I have metastatic breast cancer and often have a lot of pain. Is there any way I can manage this pain?

You are not alone; about 90 percent of patients with advanced cancer say pain is the most distressing symptom of their disease. The good news is that your pain can be controlled. Although most cancer pain is a result of a tumor pressing on bones, nerves or organs, pain can also occur as a consequence of surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Most often, cancer pain is treated with medicine usually given by a medical oncologist. However, surgery, radiation therapy and other treatments such as nerve blocks and psychological methods can be used along with medicine to provide the best possible pain relief.

Pain from other conditions can be treated along with cancer pain. Since many patients have multiple causes and types of pain, an accurate diagnosis of the cause of pain can be challenging, and effective pain management can be complex. Your best solution is to find a treatment center that uses state-of-the-art therapies to treat cancer pain.
